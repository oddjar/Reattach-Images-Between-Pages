Move image uploads (detach and reattach) between pages without uploading them again.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a drop-down menu to the Media > Edit screen that lists all of the pages in your WordPress site, and allows you to choose between them. Saving your selection reassigns the image attachment to the selected page.

Note that the drop-down menu only appears for images that were originally attached to a page. It will not appear inside the Media > Edit screen for images that were originally assigned to a post.

This code draws heavily on Andy Blackwellâ€™s tutorial on creating custom fields for image attachments at Nettuts, which was the only documentation I could find on the attachment_fields_to_edit and attachment_fields_to_save hooks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `reattach_images.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
